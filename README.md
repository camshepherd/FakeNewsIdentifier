# FakeNewsIdentifier
Basic Python scripts covering Shallow and Deep learning methods to detect whether an article is fake news or not following training on a labelled data set.

# About
This is a couple of scripts from a machine learning module in the third year of University. The scripts are based in tensorflow and scikit-learn and were optimised(but not to a great degree) over a couple of days of simulations and overheating laptops.
